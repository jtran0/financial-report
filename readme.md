Hi this is a read me document requested by Mr. Mickey Huang

I will be updating this file to show you how to use this program.

# Example usage
./financial-tracker.py -h

## Example output
{print help message including all supported bank types: [chase, wellsfargo, citi]}

# Example usage
./financial-tracker.py chase:~/statements/chase-2024-01-17.csv wellsfargo:~/statements/wellsfargo-2024-01-17.csv

## Example output
{print a list of all transactions from all given statements}


That is all that has been worked on.

thanks
